<h1> Hi! My name is <span>Kim</span>. </h1>
<br><br>

<p> I am currently attending graduate school at City College of New York to further my studies in Computer Science.</p>

<p>I'm an avid learner with experience in client-side and server-side web development using AngularJS, Django, Flask, and Jekyll. Furthermore, I have experience with game, mobile, and software development.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I'm either learning new programming languages and frameworks, cooking or just working on side projects.</p>
