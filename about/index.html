        <p> Hi! My name is Kim. I'm currently an undegraduate senior studying Computer Science at City College of New York. I'll be attending (hopefully) graduate school to further my studies in Computer Science. I'm currently an active member of the City College chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).</p>

        <p>I started programming since 2009 with c++ as my first language. My areas of interest in Computer Science includes Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Web Development.</p>

        <p>I'm currently working on a group project <a href="https://github.com/DrkSephy/git-technetium">git-technetium</a>. It''s a built using MEAN stack.<p>
