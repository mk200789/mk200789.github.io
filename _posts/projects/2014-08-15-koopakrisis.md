Super Mario World Koopa Krisis is a clone built using Javascript and <a href="http://impactjs.com">ImpactJS game engine</a>. It was developed under the City College of New York Association of Computing Machinery's (ACM) Game Development Special Interest Group (SIG) for educational purposes. The goals for this project were to create a web browser version of the replica of Nintendo's Super Mario World, explore and understand how to use ImpactJS, and to learn Javascript.
