What motivated me to create an Alexa Skill was the free t-shirt. No, I’m just kidding! But really, I’ve been passively thinking about Alexa Skill Kit (ASK) ever since I learned a bit more about Amazon echo and Alexa Voice Services (AVS) over the summer when I first started my internship at AOL.

What triggered me to finally learn how to build a skill was the past weeks in October. One of my assigned task at work was to see if I could create a skill that can read a feed; however, this task was never done. But during my time researching, every tutorial I came across seemed hard to follow — even the official tutorial post by Amazon … or maybe it was just me. <a href="https://medium.com/@kimmok/my-first-alexa-skill-da82211e8b5#.ipowk2ti5">[Read more on Medium]</a>
