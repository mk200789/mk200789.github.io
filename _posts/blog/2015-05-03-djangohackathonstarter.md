In Spring 2015, I worked on a class project called the <a href="https://github.com/mk200789/django-hackathon-starter">Django Hackathon Starter</a>. The idea of this project is to help developers save time when developing Django applications using/choosing which API to use and figuring how to use OAuth authentication.


### My Role and Experience

This project was the first time I've worked with OAuth authentication. It takes patients reading documentation, and when documentations for handling OAuth (or the API) aren't clear you need more patients! On this project, the APIs and their respective OAuth are: Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, LinkedIn, and Github. Which then also lead to being able to login through these 5 APIs.

Although Django Hackathon Starter is release for public use, there was more to it for the class portion. 
The class portion of the project exposed me to Ionic. I've never used this framework before. 

Ionic is a hybrid mobile application framework built on Apache Cordova and AngularJS using web technologies such as HTML5, Javascript, and CSS/SASS. This is where it made it more comfortable and quick to learn this framework. I was already familiar and had at least some experience with AngularJS and the web technologies.

In addition to Ionic, I've learned how to create restful APIs with Django Rest Framework.

In both of these frameworks I've just mentioned, I would create API endpoints for data retrieved from Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr and LinkedIn and have it run and displayed on the Ionic app.

Overall, learning these two frameworks was a fun experience.
