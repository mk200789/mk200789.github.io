A new year and an updated blog!

It's a new year. So, I've decided I should make some updates and changes to my site. It's winter break, and I thought this would be the right time to do some of the updates I've been wanting to do (which I have). I've changed the layout of my site a bit, the about me page, and removed the contact link. I saw no need for that particular section when I could just add the pretty icons, from <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> as replacement for it. I think it looks cool. I'm working on updating and adding some past projects on my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> section. The hardest thing about this is writing description because I usually don't have more than a few lines to write. 

Peace.
