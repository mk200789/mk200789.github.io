	<!-- <p>Fire Emblem is another clone built using Javascript and <a href="http://impactjs.com">ImpactJS game engine</a>. It was started by one of groupmate <a href="http://chessmasterhong.github.io">Kevin Chen</a>, and was further developed during the semester under the City College of New York Association of Computing Machinery’s Game Development Special Interest Group. Just as our previous collaboration, <a href="/blog/2014/05/02/firstproject.html">Super Mario: Koopa Krisis</a>.</p>

<h3 id="my-role-and-experience">My Role and Experience</h3>

<p>This was the second project I worked on under CCNY ACM  Game Development SIG. It is also the second game I’ve worked on using ImpactJS. I was given a few tasks for this project which includes working on experience and level-up system , tinting enemy sprites, toggle camera between the player and mouse cursor.</p>

<p>As regarding to my experience. Initially, because I have not played the gameFire Emblem, it wasn’t too clear as to what this clone should be. But by researching the game, I’ve learned and figured out the goal of it, which made it easier for me to carry out my task at ease.</p>

<p>The Fire Emblem clone is different game in general compared to <a href="/smw-koopa-krisis">SMW Koopa Krisis</a> project. It was much more complex, less different AI’s to implement, and a much maturer experience and level-up system compared to the SMW Koopa Krisis project.</p>

<p>Overall, the prior project was a good foundation to start off with project.</p>
