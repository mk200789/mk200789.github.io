<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>

<p>Last spring semester, I joined a portfolio development program called CUNY Codes. This program caters to helping tech majors or individuals who are interested in developing an app from the ground up, to be able to learn, hone and display their skills. Most importantly it allows recent grads or soon to be grads to have more hands-on experience all within 10 week-span. I joined CUNY Codes to mainly build my social skills, in addition I just learned iOS development! So, I wanted to be able to apply what I just learned to a project, not a solo project! I know my weak point is being able to communicate clearly about my thought processes, which I’m still working on; so, by joining I was able to work on that aspect.</p>

<p>There is something different from creating something on your own versus creating something with other people: communication. Things can get so complicated! Especially when there is a group of people from different backgrounds, different programming experiences, and most importantly different thought processes! <a href="https://medium.com/@kimmok/cuny-codes-d5143f0b9aaa#.81ccpui2z">[Read More on Medium]</a></p>
