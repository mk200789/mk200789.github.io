<p>Super Mario World Koopa Krisis is a clone built using Javascript and <a href="http://impactjs.com">ImpactJS game engine</a>. It was developed under the City College of New York Association of Computing Machinery’s (ACM) Game Development Special Interest Group (SIG) for educational purposes. The goals for this project were to create a web browser version of the replica of Nintendo’s Super Mario World, explore and understand how to use ImpactJS, and to learn Javascript.</p>

<p>#My Role and Experience</p>

<p>Prior to this project, I’ve never worked on a project with Javascript nor have I had much knowledge of the language. Moreover, I have never worked on a game, let alone did I have any experience with game engines. Working on SMW Koopa Krisis was a good experience, I learned Javascript and the structure of and how to use ImpactJS game engine.</p>

<p>I was given a role to implement some enemy AIs. I started with implementing the basic stalking enemy, eventually I building more sophosticated enemies which included timer and detection.</p>
