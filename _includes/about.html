				<p> I am currently attending graduate school at City College of New York to further my studies in Computer Science.</p>

				<p>Throughout my years as an undergraduate I've dabbled in different projects using different technologies and frameworks such as Django, Jekyll, ImpactJS, and AngularJS. Most of the projects' are mostly back-end and front-end contrated. You can say, I'm very much interesting in web development. </p>

				<p>I'm currently a web developer at <a href="http://vendedy.com">Vendedy</a>. When I'm not coding, I'm either eating, experimenting with baking, or just working on side projects.</p>
